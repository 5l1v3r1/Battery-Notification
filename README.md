# Battery-Notification
Alerts if battery level drops below 20% or is above 80% with AC input on.

Make sure to Install the 'pywin32-219.win32-py2.7.exe' setup , it installs the 'win32api' module of python.

Run the winnotif.pyw directly, it'll run hidden and alert when the battery thresholds are reached. 

Feel free to modify the time periods of balloon notifications and the battery alert threshold according to your needs.
